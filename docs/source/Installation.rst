Installation
============

Installation of Bashfuscator is simple. Just follow these steps:

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:

   sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-argcomplete xclip
   git clone https://github.com/Bashfuscator/Bashfuscator
   cd Bashfuscator
   python3 setup.py install --user

Bashfuscator should now be installed onto your PATH and ready to go!

.. note::
    Bashfuscator is written in Python 3, Python 2 is NOT supported and will probably not
    run Bashfuscator properly.
